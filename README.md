# Coding auxiliary tools
 Repository piece of codes that I use often enough to want have it stored, but sparced enough to forget how to do it. Hope it can help other fellow programmers.

## Array reverser [x86 Assembly]
Inverts an array, pretty self explanatory. I dont know if it is more efficient than do that in C ansi and let the compiler optimize it.

## Line counter [PYTHON]
A code in python I did to count how many lines in a script are really code lines. The plang.csv contains info about what indicates a comentary, a block and stuff like that in different languages. Still in prototype.

## Simple List [C ANSI]
An example with a simple linked list of integers in C ANSI. For change it to a more elaborated list, with more data types in each position, one can change the struct of the list_node, and including the the new tipes values in the functions args. For more elaborated nodes, maybe would be interesting build a node "constructor" function. I created a list as an entire separated structure just to make my work easy, since the "list structure" could carry some meta about the list itself, like sum of all elements, lenght, or even an array pointing to all elements. It is also easy to convert it to a double linked list or other data structure this way.

## Text Man
A directory of some text manipulation scripts, like a boxing script.
